# Content Monorepo

This monorepo is part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

It's based on [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) and it's structured as fallows:

```text
- src
  + packages
  |  # Leaf packages that will be used by services and web
  + services
  |  # Mostly Web APIs and event consumers and producers
  + web
  |  # Websites
```
